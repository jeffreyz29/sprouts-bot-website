## ‚öôÔ∏è Log Configuration

### Dual Confirmation System

When setting up logging channels, the bot provides dual confirmations:

1. **Command Channel** - Immediate confirmation where command was used
2. **Logging Channel** - Test message sent to the configured log channel

**Example Process:**
```
# Administrator runs:
s.cmdlogs set #bot-commands

# Bot responds in current channel:
"‚úÖ Command logging enabled for #bot-commands"

# Bot also sends to #bot-commands:
"üîß This channel is now receiving command logs"
```

### Log Channel Requirements

**Channel Permissions:**
- Bot needs **Send Messages** permission
- Bot needs **Embed Links** permission for formatted logs
- Bot needs **Read Message History** for context
- Recommended: **Manage Messages** for cleanup

**Channel Setup Recommendations:**
- Use dedicated logging channels
- Restrict access to administrators only
- Set up channel topics explaining log purpose
- Consider channel slowmode for high-volume logs
