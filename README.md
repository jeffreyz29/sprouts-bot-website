{% hint style="danger" %}
Sprouts requires certain permissions to function correctly. Please ensure the bot has the necessary roles and access in your server, including managing messages, reading channels, and sending messages. Insufficient permissions may prevent some features, like tickets, embeds, or auto responders, from working properly.
